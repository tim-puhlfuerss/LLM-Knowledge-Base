# LLM Knowledge Base

## Purpose

The world of large language models (LLMs) is changing rapidly.
Here is some help keeping track.

The LLM Knowledge Base is a personal collection of helpful information and sources about LLMs created by [tim-puhlfuerss](https://tim-puhlfuerss.github.io/).
This collection can help you explore the domain of LLMs and related research and toolkits.

While it may resemble one of those 'Awesome' lists, the LLM Knowledge Base is currently a personal compilation of notes and news.
It does not claim to be exhaustive but aims to provide you with a wealth of insights.
